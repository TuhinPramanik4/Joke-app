# Joke app
 It's a web app , in which you can add your custom jokes , people will be able to give feedback of it . And the other major feature is you can add your favourite Creator over here , and let people upvote and downvote them as their likeing .
 
 //Teah Stack : 
 What tech I have used to build it ? For front end it's EJS AND Tailwind , And for the backend , It's just Node and express . And Mongo DB as Data base .
 
 //Future Implimentation :
i want to add AI feature in it  which will genearate random jokes by its own , and will impliment Authentication , so  that people can't upvote or downvote a particullar creator more than once
